    <h2>My life choices</h2>
        <p>
            Studying abroad is never an easy decision for you and your family. In Germany I already did an internship about the same topic of this program <br/> and from there on I decided that I want to do 
            something like this in my future. Since Jönköping University was the only university in Sweden that had <br/>the program that I wanted in english, it was the only university that 
            I wrote myslef into. To explain everyone my choice thorougly, I made a prersentation <br/>about every aspect that was important.
            I will list some of my resaons why I decided to study here at Jönköping University:
            <ul>
                <li>Sweden is close to Germany geografically</li>
                <li>I will have more possibilities after my graduation (see gif)</li>
                <li>I can expand my knowledge about culture and language</li>
                <li>Sweden is in some aspects better than Germany</li>
                <li>...</li>
            </ul>

    <h2 class="middle-text">My free time</h2>
        <p> I do a lot of different things: dancing, sewing, playing video games, and more that I can not think of right now. <br/>
            I love hanging out with friends and experience funny moments  and if we are not together, we are hanging out in Discord and play <br/>differernt
             games in online multiplayers or start talking about random things while playing Bloons TD6. <br/>
            As my family is very active, we went to a lot of trips since I was young till today. We visit Bulgaria every year and enjoy the beach and the <br/>delicious food. 
            And in the winter we usually go skiing either in Austria or Swizerland, but it would be very exciting to also ski in a differernt country one day.
