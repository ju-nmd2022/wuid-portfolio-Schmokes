                  Studying abroad is never an easy decision for you and your family. In Germany I already did an internship about the same topic of this program and from there on I decided that I want to do 
                  something like this in my future. Since Jönköping University was the only university in Sweden that had the program that I wanted in english, it was the only university that 
                 I wrote myslef into. To explain everyone my choice thorougly, I made a prersentation about every aspect that was important.
                 I will list some of my resaons why I decided to study here at Jönköping University:
                 <ul>
                    <li>Sweden is close to Germany geografically</li>
                   <li>I will have more possibilities after my graduation (see gif)</li>
                   <li>I can expand my knowledge about culture and language</li>
                   <li>Sweden is in some aspects better than Germany</li>
                   <li>...</li>
                 </ul>
                  </p>

             </div>
             <h2 class="middle-text">My free time</h2>
                 <p> I do a lot of different things: dancing, sewing, playing video games, and more that I can not think of right now. 
                     I love hanging out with friends and experience funny moments  and if we are not together, we are hanging out in Discord and play differernt
                     games in online multiplayers or start talking about random things while playing Bloons TD6. 
                     As my family is very active, we went to a lot of trips since I was young till today. We visit Bulgaria every year and enjoy the beach and the delicious food. 
                     And in the winter we usually go skiing either in Austria or Swizerland, but it would be very exciting to also ski in a differernt country one day.
