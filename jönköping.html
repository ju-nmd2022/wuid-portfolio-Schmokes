            <p> 
            Jönköping is surrounded by beautiful nature. There are three lakes that are part of Jönköping's infrastructure, Munksjön, Rocksjön and Vättern which is one of the biggest lakes in Sweden.
            The landscape in Småland is very similar to that in the south of Germany: mountainous, green, many trees and lakes. This allows the residents and tourists to enjoy the nature by going on hikes or bike tours.
            It is also very popular to take a walk around Munksjön or along the coast of Vättern.

    <h2>Going out</h2>
    <div class="group">  
        <p>
            Speaking from my own experience, I have been visiting various places already in Jönköping. As a student, Akademien is the one student club where you can party hard with your friends and make new friends each night out. 
            Near Akademien you can find another club which is open for everybody if you want something different for once as well as different drinks as well as music that is played. 
            As for restaurants, there are a lot of them stationed on the coast of Munksjön but they are quite expensive for a student budget. Recently, I visited the restaurant <em>Pinchos</em>. It has his own unique style of a circus.
            You can choose form a big menu of small portioned food which is very tasty and since they are only small portions of the food, it is very tempting to try something new. They have drinks of each category for every customer 
            which have somethimes a funny thought behind them.
